# Dive is a bot that will create a cloud drive from medias sent on your server !


Once the bot is invited into your server, 
it will listen and register any media you send into its database.
From this, you can access any file that your shared on https://diveapp.ga
Each file sent on Discord is stored into its cdn from 180 days so it will be available 180 days on our platfrom.
We are working for a Google drive integration that could provide long-term storage.
