    <h1>General informations</h1>
    <h2>
        Dive is a discord bot that will only catch and store links to media from cloud storage providers (like Discord cdn or Google Drive and many others) that is shared on a discord server.
        <br>
        As so, we are in not responsible in any way of what is shared on any Discord server, and by extension indexed by Dive, that could be problematic.
        <br>
        If anything is breaking a law in your country, we are not responsible.
